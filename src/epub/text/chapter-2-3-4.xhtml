<h5>TURBA TURMA</h5>


<p>According to the compass there are thirty-two winds, that is
to say, thirty-two points. But these directions may be subdivided
indefinitely. Classed by its directions, the wind is incalculable;
classed by its kinds, it is infinite. Homer himself
would have shrunk from the task of enumerating them.</p>

<p>The polar current encounters the tropical current. Heat and
cold are thus combined; the equilibrium is distributed by a
shock, the wave of wind issues forth and is distended, scattered
and broken up in every direction in fierce streams. The dispersion
of the gusts shakes the streaming locks of the wind upon
the four corners of the horizon.</p>

<p>All the winds which blow are there. The wind of the Gulf
Stream, which disgorges the great fogs of Newfoundland; the
wind of Peru, in the region of silent heavens, where no man ever
heard the thunder roar; the wind of Nova Scotia, where flies
the great auk (<i>Alca impennis</i>) with his furrowed beak; the iron
whirlwinds of the Chinese seas; the wind of Mozambique, which
destroys the canoes and junks; the electric wind, which the
people of Japan denounce by the beating of a gong; the African
wind, which blows between Table Mountain and the Devil's
Peak, where it gains its liberty; the currents of the equator,
which pass over the trade winds, describing a parabola, the
summit of which is always to the west; the Plutonian wind,
which issues from craters, the terrible breath of flames; the
singular wind peculiar to the volcano Awa, which occasions a
perpetual olive tint in the north; the Java monsoon, against
which the people construct those casemates known as hurricane
houses; the branching north winds called by the English
"Bush winds;" the curved squalls of the Straits of Malacca,
observed by Horsburgh; the powerful south-west wind, called
Pampero in Chili, and Rebojo at Buenos Ayres, which carries
the great condor out to sea, and saves him from the pit where
the Indian, concealed under a bullock-hide newly stripped,
watches for him, lying on his back and bending his great bow
with his feet; the chemical wind, which, according to Lemery,
produces thunder-bolts from the clouds; the Harmattan of
the Caffres; the Polar snow-driver, which harnesses itself to the
everlasting icebergs; the wind of the Gulf of Bengal, which
sweeps over a continent to pillage the triangular town of wooden
booths at Nijni-Novogorod, in which is held the great fair of
Asia; the wind of the Cordilleras, agitator of great waves and
forests; the wind of the Australian Archipelago, where the
bee-hunters take the wild hives hidden under the forks of the
branches of the giant eucalyptus; the Sirocco, the Mistral, the
Hurricane, the dry winds, the inundating and diluvian winds,
the torrid winds, which scatter dust from the plains of Brazil
upon the streets of Genoa, which both obey and revolt against
diurnal rotation, and of which Herrara said, "<i>Malo viento torna
contra el sol</i>;" those winds which hunt in couples, conspiring
mischief, the one undoing the work of the other; and those
old winds which assailed Columbus on the coast of Veragua,
and which during forty days, from the 21st of October to the
28th of November 1520, delayed and nearly frustrated Magellan's
approach to the Pacific; and those which dismasted the
Armada and confounded Philip II. Others, too, there are, of
the names of which there is no end. The winds, for instance,
which carry showers of frogs and locusts, and drive before them
clouds of living things across the ocean; those which blow in
what are called "Wind-leaps," and whose function is to destroy
ships at sea; those which at a single blast throw the cargo out
of trim, and compel the vessel to continue her course half
broadside over; the winds which construct the circum-cumuli;
the winds which mass together the circum-strati; the dark
heavy winds swelled with rains; the winds of the hailstorms;
the fever winds, whose approach sets the salt springs and sulphur
springs of Calabria boiling; those which give a glittering appearance
to the fur of African panthers, prowling among the bushes of
Cape Ferro; those which come shaking from the cloud, like the
tongue of a trigonocephal, the terrible forked lightning; and
those which bring whirlwinds of black snow. Such is the legion
of winds.</p>

<p>The Douvres rock heard their distant tramp at the moment
when Gilliatt was constructing his breakwater.</p>

<p>As we have said, the wind means the combination of all the
winds of the earth.</p>
